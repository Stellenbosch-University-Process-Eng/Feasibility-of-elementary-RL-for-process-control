This repository contains MATLAB code used during the MEng study: **_A Feasibility Study of Elementary Reinforcement Learning-Based Process Control_**  
SARSA and Q-learning were applied to Case Study 1 (the control of liquid level in a self-regulatory water tank).  
One-Step Actor-Critic was applied to Case Study 3 (the control of particle size estimate in a grinding circuit model).
